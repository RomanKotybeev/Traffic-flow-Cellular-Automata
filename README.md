## <h2>Cellular automata</h2>
  
  
[Cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) was the main tools for modeling.
A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states.

In my case the grid of cells contains such states as CeLLType, directions, movePermision, velocities:
States = **[cellType, directions, movePermision, velocities]**

CellType is what kind of cell it represents. It can be *wall, traffic light, road, car*. **Wall** is a a state of cells which a car can't go through.
**Road** is a state of cells which a car can move. **Car** CellType for a car, **traffic light** for a traffic light.

**Directions** show the way a car can move. I did it with vectors where a value of the first index is y-coordinate, the second is x-coordinate -> (y,x). The reference point is in the top right corner, y-axis is directed to down, x-axis is directed to right. 
The first and second coordintaes with the sign(+/-) show possible movements along y-axis and x-axis respectively. If 0, it can't move. If Â±1, it can move.

Here the thing. If any car tries to cross the center of the road, it will continue to move diagonally (the both coordinates allow to move). To prevent this I decided to make another states called **move permissions**. Moreover, it allows to implement a traffic light. 
The traffic light has 4 states. The *GREEN* one allows to move along x-axis, the *RED* one allows to move along y-axis, the last *RED TO GREEN* and *GREEN TO RED* are for switching from the GREEN state to the RED state. 

Traffic light switches | Move permission for RED | Move permission for GREEN
